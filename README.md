C# Space Shooter
================
My first game in C# using the [MonoGame](http://monogame.org/) library.  
This game was coded and compiled for GNU/Linux, but you should be able to compile the code for any platform that MonoGame supports.

Controls
--------
* Arrow Keys: Move
* Spacebar: Shoot
* Enter: Start game (at the black screen which is suppose to be the title screen)

TODO
----
* Add a title to start screen  and add a gameover screen.
* ~~Add score text instead of having it on the window title.~~
